Pointer Syntax
==============
Two relevant operators are the * and & characters, which have the following
meanings.

- Pointer is a variable that stores the address of another variable.  That's it - I'm not sure why it has to be more complicated than that.
- Contents of a pointer will be a whole number address
- Pointer in C is always initialized to null
